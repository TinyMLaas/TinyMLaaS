## Daily 15.2.2023

- Doc directory is not yet set up. Nella will create that when she has rewritten daily notes.
- Matias has familiarized himself with integrating Python tests to CI.
- Bona and Matias will collaborate on listing models.
- Tuula and Nella will collaborate on choosing an image dataset from a list. They both need to explore what Arttu has done on his previous PR.
- Arttu's PR has been merged to the main repo and therefore, there shouldn't be any dependencies left on Sprint 2 items.
- Reminder that Sprint review is held from 10 to 12 on Friday at Kumpula. Matias has sent meeting invitations to everyone.
