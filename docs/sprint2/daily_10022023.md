- Arttu has finalized the training of the model. Few challenges in Docker environment; the model seems to be 'perfect', when it shouldn't and UI needs to be improved.
- Borna and Nella have been able to convert Jupyter notebooks correctly to python files. However, pytest isn't working, since python functions are not correctly imported.
- Leevi is working on sending the image data via a network. Faced some issues, but help has been already asked from Hiroshi.  
- Tuula has finalized research on relevant UI/Services. Problems committing changes to the main repo.
- The team will meet at Luola on Tuesday.
